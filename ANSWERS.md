- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?  
       - Class Components are able to hold state and use lifecycle methods

- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.
        - Mounting: When you initialize the state and render the component.
        - Updating: When you change the state of a component, using setState, which then forces a call      to render
        - Un-mounting: The componentWillUnmount method is called for any clean up that needs to be          done. 

- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?
        - it adds functionality to your normal hooks. It contains the hook, a method, and return.

- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?
        - testing our apps allows up to catch bugs and problems during the development phase before the code works it way into production code.
